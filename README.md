# pingport
This ping tool provides robust connection testing. It pings the host and connects to its port every minute. Additionally, it checks bandwidth every half hour using three different methods. The tool downloads test files from two remote hosts, downloads a YouTube video, and downloads test files from two other remote hosts.
